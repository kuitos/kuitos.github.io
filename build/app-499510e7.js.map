For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n\t   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n\t   *\n\t   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n\t   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n\t   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n\t   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n\t   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n\t   *\n\t   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n\t   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n\t   *\n\t   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n\t   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n\t   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n\t   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n\t   *\n\t   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n\t   *\n\t   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n\t   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n\t   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n\t   *\n\t   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n\t   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n\t   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n\t   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n\t   *\n\t   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n\t   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n\t   *     }\n\t   *\n\t   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   */\n\t  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n\t    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t      return false;\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n\t      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n\t      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n\t      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t        return true;\n\t      }\n\t      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t        return false;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    return false;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJS(json, converter) {\n\t    return converter ?\n\t      fromJSWith(converter, json, '', {'': json}) :\n\t      fromJSDefault(json);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJSWith(converter, json, key, parentJSON) {\n\t    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n\t      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, IndexedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n\t    }\n\t    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n\t      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, KeyedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n\t    }\n\t    return json;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJSDefault(json) {\n\t    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n\t      return IndexedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toList();\n\t    }\n\t    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n\t      return KeyedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toMap();\n\t    }\n\t    return json;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function isPlainObj(value) {\n\t    return value && (value.constructor === Object || value.constructor === undefined);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  var src_Math__imul =\n\t    typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2 ?\n\t    Math.imul :\n\t    function imul(a, b) {\n\t      a = a | 0; // int\n\t      b = b | 0; // int\n\t      var c = a & 0xffff;\n\t      var d = b & 0xffff;\n\t      // Shift by 0 fixes the sign on the high part.\n\t      return (c * d) + ((((a >>> 16) * d + c * (b >>> 16)) << 16) >>> 0) | 0; // int\n\t    };\n\t\n\t  // v8 has an optimization for storing 31-bit signed numbers.\n\t  // Values which have either 00 or 11 as the high order bits qualify.\n\t  // This function drops the highest order bit in a signed number, maintaining\n\t  // the sign bit.\n\t  function smi(i32) {\n\t    return ((i32 >>> 1) & 0x40000000) | (i32 & 0xBFFFFFFF);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function hash(o) {\n\t    if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n\t      return 0;\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof o.valueOf === 'function') {\n\t      o = o.valueOf();\n\t      if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n\t        return 0;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t    if (o === true) {\n\t      return 1;\n\t    }\n\t    var type = typeof o;\n\t    if (type === 'number') {\n\t      var h = o | 0;\n\t      if (h !== o) {\n\t        h ^= o * 0xFFFFFFFF;\n\t      }\n\t      while (o > 0xFFFFFFFF) {\n\t        o /= 0xFFFFFFFF;\n\t        h ^= o;\n\t      }\n\t      return smi(h);\n\t    }\n\t    if (type === 'string') {\n\t      return o.length > STRING_HASH_CACHE_MIN_STRLEN ? cachedHashString(o) : hashString(o);\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof o.hashCode === 'function') {\n\t      return o.hashCode();\n\t    }\n\t    return hashJSObj(o);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function cachedHashString(string) {\n\t    var hash = stringHashCache[string];\n\t    if (hash === undefined) {\n\t      hash = hashString(string);\n\t      if (STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE === STRING_HASH_CACHE_MAX_SIZE) {\n\t        STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE = 0;\n\t        stringHashCache = {};\n\t      }\n\t      STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE++;\n\t      stringHashCache[string] = hash;\n\t    }\n\t    return hash;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // http://jsperf.com/hashing-strings\n\t  function hashString(string) {\n\t    // This is the hash from JVM\n\t    // The hash code for a string is computed as\n\t    // s[0] * 31 ^ (n - 1) + s[1] * 31 ^ (n - 2) + ... + s[n - 1],\n\t    // where s[i] is the ith character of the string and n is the length of\n\t    // the string.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode.
